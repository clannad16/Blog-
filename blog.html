                  Accurate grading of grains is critical to ensure that an objective standard is used to determine the price of the grain, thus protecting both the buyer and seller.

                  Where buyers are close to the source of the grain, e.g. in local markets, they have direct access to the product and therefore, some control over quality assessment. However, where grain is traded over large distances, particularly internationally, the buyer will have no direct influence over the quality.
                  
                  For the seller, the absence of standard grading processes results in subjectivity and uncertainty over the realised vs realisable price.
                  
                  The use of grading standards can send a clear indication of quality requirements to both producer and the buyer. With over 420 standard test methods, including at least 75 of those that are internationally applicable, it is apparent that there is a large diversity in grain measurement and grading.
                  
                  Indias Grading Challenges
                  
                  Grain grading remains a major challenge in India. In a majority of villages, traders just approach a farmer at the market, cursorily inspect the grain by hand and quote the price they're willing to pay him. The farmer has no scientific way to assess the grain quality in order to demand a fair price. With a lack of scientific data, all that prevails is the ad hoc price that the trader quotes based on his judgement.
                  
                  Research work into methods for instantly assessing the quality of grains holds the key to grain grading systems of the future. In India, there are a couple of “portable” devices that can assess the quality of grains and pulses. However, not only are such devices prohibitively expensive (costing upwards of Rs. 15 lakhs) but they are also very bulky to be carried around, especially in remote farms, making them sub-optimal for on-field grading.

                  India is not only among the world's leading producers of Milk, Foodgrains (Cereals and Pulses), Fruits and Vegetables (F&V) but also produces ample Sugarcane, Cotton, Fish, and Poultry.

                  In fact, in 2019-20, India's total production of Foodgrains reached a record high of 296.65 million tonnes and total horticultural production peaked at an all-time high of 320.48 million tonnes.
                  
                  The real crux of India’s food scarcity issue is the sheer size of the country’s fragmented supply chain that makes the entire agricultural ecosystem complex for all stakeholders. It takes anywhere between 7 to 11 steps for food to travel from farm to fork i.e., from the farmer to the consumer!
                  
                  Moreover, the lack of a seamless information flow between all stakeholders of the agri value chain also poses a major hurdle. The lack of timely and accurate information available with all market participants leads to high levels of food loss. The limited demand visibility with food producers results in disrupted supplies, volatile prices, and ultimately low renumeration for farmers and uncertain supplies and prices for discerning consumers.
                  
                  The food loss issue is so concerning that according to a UN report, an estimated 931 million tonnes of food was wasted globally in 2019 with India alone losing food that is equivalent to the total amount of food consumed in the whole of Brazil.
                  
                  To rejuvenate the country's food economy, India needs to use her technological prowess to reimagine a tech-driven supply chain that:
                  
                  a) Ensures that all market participants are seamlessly interconnected on a single, unified tech platform that facilitates real-time information availability.
                  
                  b) Provides integrated Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Language (ML) analytics tools that optimises the entire supply chain, and
                  
                  c) Automates a major chunk of the supply chain to not only ensure enhanced productivity but also facilitate faster and agile handling of perishable products.

                  Zooming into our home country, agriculture is still predominantly practiced as a primary source of income by a significant percentage of the population. The sector still contributes 15-20% to the national GDP, irrespective of the changing trends towards the secondary and tertiary sectors. The movements held by the farmers, often supported by the masses, have led to timely changes in the industry standards, remuneration as well as drive technological changes. This ranges from increase in Minimum Support Prices (MSP) for crops to acquiring subsidies for latest technologies and required inputs. However, the harsh reality attests to the fact that majority of the farmers in India are micro land holder, i.e., they operate on a farm holding of approximately 1-2 hectares. The effects of this are observed in their lack of adaptation to mixed farming or latest forms of technology, which not only reduce the yield produced by their farm and their income but also reduce the nutritional value of the crop. While different measures and schemes have been rolled out to support the farmers through different means, such as the development of the Farmer Producer Organizations, an approach of duality must be followed to ensure farmer and crop benefits.

                  While one way to ensure marginal farmer sustenance is the development of FPOs in the country, which ensure more efficient usage and provision of technology for modern agriculture, another medium is the movement towards regenerative farming. Regenerative farmers have a significant impact on the type of food that goes on the plates of the people, with it becoming increasingly important as people are moving towards a more natural and regenerative lifestyle. The lack of chemicals and pesticides with which the crops are grown ensures that one gets adequate nutrients without the long term impact on health.
                  
                  The practise and disseminating knowledge of regenerative farming via training at FarmEasy serves a dual purpose with respect to its long term goals and vision, i.e., improving rural livelihood and climate action. The practice of regenerative farming increases the yield of the crop, improves the nutritional value of soil and increases the income of the farmer to name a few of its overarching benefits. The FarmEasy OARS Model farm not only engages in these practices firsthand, but also conducts training programs to spread the discourse pertaining to regenerative farming and its technicalities.

                  In the year 2021, 2,844 farmers have been contracted by FarmEasy’s Outgrow Programme, while 78 farmers have undergone training at the OARS Model Farm. Such regenerative practices of natural fertilizers, zero tillage, organic manure, cover crops, livestock integration, integrated nutrient management, soil testing, automated irrigation and more has ensured significant increase in crop yield while also making it a profitable and self-sustaining farm.

                  India’s Cold Chain Challenge

                  The United Nations (UN) estimates that more than 40 percent of food produced in India is wasted before it reaches the consumer. Keeping perishables fresh during transit is a challenge in India's diverse weather.
                  
                  
                  One of the major reasons for food wastage is the lack of an efficient cold chain infrastructure that includes refrigerated transport, pack houses, collection centers, and cold storage.
                  
                  To reduce food loss, strengthen food security, and improve rural livelihoods, India must close the logistical gap between farm and fork. Cold chain inefficiencies are responsible for up to half of post-harvest food losses in the country. A more effective cold chain would bring farmers closer to consumers, assuring them of fairer prices and access to new markets. Moreover, the optimization of the supply chain of perishables can ensure the reduction in food wastage and better utilization of the food stock.
                  
                  
                  Making sustainable cold chains a reality in India was envisaged in the India Cooling Action Plan (ICAP) that highlights the missing elements of the cold chain, which would be key to reducing food loss. The missing elements include ripening chambers, refrigerated transport, and rural packhouses – organized facilities where farmers’ produce is aggregated, pre-cooled, and packed. According to ICAP, India needs over 125,000 rural packhouses against 500 packhouses that we have today.
                  
                  There is an urgent need for improving supply chain efficiency and an innovative analytics-led platform to intelligently connect farmers to consumers with reduced Food Miles, minimum wastage, and better returns.

                  As a little child, all of us would have asked the question - Where does food come from? How does it give us energy? The answer to these questions quite easily could be something that we walk on every day. Soil has and always will be something that plays a vital role not just in the environment but also in human nutrition.

 
                  Nutrition is a vital part of health and development. It has been an ongoing topic for quite some time with regard to improving infant, child and maternal health, stronger immune systems, safer pregnancy, and lower risk of diseases.
                  
                   
                  As we look at the brightly coloured fruits and vegetables in the grocery stores we believe that they are of high nutritional qualities. Still, many believe that these very same fruits and vegetables grown today carry fewer nutrients than those that were available years ago. As many would say, what our ancestors ate were rich in nutrients than what we are eating today.
                  
                   
                  Presently, after the COVID-19 pandemic, the world has become highly food conscious. But the numbers show otherwise, according to WHO 149 million children under 5 yrs of age are too short for their age (stunted), 45 million children under 5 yrs of age are too thin for their height (wasted), 39 million children under 5 are Overweight or obese, 33% of women of reproductive age have anaemia and 15% babies are born with Low birth weight.
                  
                   
                  Now, how do we reverse the nutrient decline? Changing farming methods is one of the game changers in producing healthy produce for a balanced diet. There are numerous agricultural practices that could be used to improve the nutrient output and improve the health of all people who depend on the agricultural systems for their sustenance. Good farming practices are essential in ensuring that the soil is also good thereby ensuring that the crop yield has a healthy nutritional value.

                  Though it is scarce in agribusiness in India, FarmEasy achieved this for the fruits and vegetable business unit based in Chennai. This is a milestone and has its own significance for FarmEasy. This is a sheer display of the company's culture of continual improvement and commitment towards "safer food, better health". This certification is also a great motivational booster for the team, who have put tremendous effort and adopted quality as a culture. It confirms our best in class food safety and management system, and ensures the best in quality for our consumers.

 
                  This is just the beginning, and FarmEasy is marching on its way to continually improve the food safety management systems across their distribution centre, while setting up a very high benchmark in food quality and safety management for the financial year 2022-23. Infact, FarmEasy is also working towards achieving GFSI ( Global Food Safety Initiative ), a recognized certification for business units.
                  
                   
                  FarmEasy Foods and Products Private limited, with this certification is committed to keeping the customers satisfied with quality and safe produce and continuously works towards keeping the facilities in line with the statutory and regulatory requirements complying with FSSAI, legal metrology and follows the principles and standards of ISO 22000:2018.
                  
                   
                  We believe in the continuous improvement of food safety management systems, which is accomplished by improving employees' competence skills through regular training, implementing good warehouse practices, and driving the organization's food safety management systems through efficient and effective digitization. The top management also appointed a food safety team leader, who monitors the performance of food safety management systems regularly and reports the results to the top management for further improvement.
                  
                   
                  FarmEasy procures fresh produce from farmers through its network of collection centres and delivers quality products to industries such as e-commerce platforms, food services and big retail chain customers.
